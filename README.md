## Summary 
A bike sharing program could be good for the community and if properly located could provide a good value stream. A subscriber model appears to be the best approach. Location of the bike would be important to assess and reevaluate as any program would move forward. A bike maintenance program would be important to make considerations for when evaluating cash flow from a subscriber model. 

Additional visualizations showing proximity of bikes to areas of interest in the community could be helpful. Breaking demographics out further - especially regarding usage by women could be helpful. Additional data to understand seasonality would be helpful. Is this a seasonal or year long program.
